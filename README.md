# DB3 - decentralized database

A NEARCON 2022 Hackathon project by Blockwatch

## Intro

Decentralized networks heavily rely on centralized providers to host and access their data today. NEAR is no exception. For truly decentralized systems we need to think about how SaaS databases would look like in a web 3 economy? How can you trust responses are correct, queries are not censored and data is available at the latency your dapp requires?

DB3 is a decentralized web3 database network where service providers get paid for query execution. DB3 is permission-less - anybody can deploy, host, discover and query databases. Developers implement database schemas + logic and deploy them as smart contracts. Hosts choose which databases to run based on interest and expected traffic. Hosts must lock a slashable security deposit and (co)-sign query results to prove correctness. Users attach fee payments to queries and send them directly to a set of hosts for execution. On successful and timely execution, the protocol pays out collected fees to hosts and a royalty share to developers.
